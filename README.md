## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The source data set that this project was based on was obtained from the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)


## Files
This repository contains 3 main files:

 - `README.md` This file provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
 - `run_analysis.R` This script is used to build up and perform the analysis on the required sample data.
 - `tidy_data.txt`  This is the final output from the `run_analysis.R` script.  It contains a cleansed version of the sample data.
 - `CodeBook.md` Describes the processing steps and variables used in `run_analysis.R`.
